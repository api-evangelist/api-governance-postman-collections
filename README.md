# API Governance Postman Collections

This is a collection of requests that can be used to evaluate a Postman API for specific rules and guidelines established as part of the governance of APIs being deployed across an organization. Applying tests to not the request or response of an API, but actually applying it to the details of the APIs design.

This collection is an evolving set of API governance requests and is meant to demonstrate how Postman testing can be used for API design governance, allowing anyone to fork and begin evolving to meet their own needs when it comes to governance. This collection is being evolved and managed using GitHub, so if you have any questions or requests you can submit a GitHub issue on the repository.

If you have any requests for new API governance rules, find bugs, or have questions about how it works feel free to submit as a GitHub issue, and I'll work to consider as I move this API governance Postman collection forward.
